Software for parallel solving PDEs, ODEs, and maybe other things

Hopefully I'll get around to making this. I'd like it to solve PDEs using finite difference method and ODEs using variety of numerical methods.
Early idea:
- program for user to input parameters/conditions, and generate a file that is interpreted by the "solver" program and the corresponding equation/conditions are solved.
